\f0\fs28 \cf0 This is the beginning of my audio project. So far it has the recognizable FaceTime call audio and me saying hello to my mom. I\'92ll also add a bit of dialogue with her referencing my trip so the audience is set up for what is coming next. Then it goes into jump cuts of me packing and leaving my house for the bus. I zip up my bag, flick off my light, and shut the door. I added music to fade in once I start my journey traveling. The music I chose that sounds like music you would find in a YouTube travel vlog. I did this because most people who watch YouTube will recognize the happy loop music that indicates a travel montage. For my next steps, I will record some sounds from the bus station, when they take my ticket, and meeting up with my family. After that I\'92ll have New York traffic noises to show the change of scene. I\'92ll have remarks from my family about where we are and recognizable audio from New York like traffic, street vendors, music from stores, etc.\'a0When we eat dinner, I\'92ll have audio of us ordering and other recognizable restaurant sounds. Then I\'92ll take the audience through the Broadway theater. This will include getting our tickets scanned, being in the crowded lobby, finding our seats, and maybe even the opening announcements (I\'92ll have to see if that would be illegal). If my audio is long enough I would like to end the project with the start of the Broadway show because I don\'92t think I need the narrative to go full circle. The story of my project is traveling to New York for the show, so the show can be the resolution.
